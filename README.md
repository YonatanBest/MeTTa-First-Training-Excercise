# MeTTa First Training Exercise

This repository contains four foundational exercises implemented in the **MeTTa** programming language. Each function is designed to demonstrate recursive thinking and list manipulation in MeTTa.

## Contents

### 1. Sum of Multiples of 3 or 5 Below a Given Number
**Description:**
- This function calculates the sum of all natural numbers below a given limit that are multiples of 3 or 5.
- For example, for numbers below 10, the multiples are 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum is 23.

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrates recursion to iterate through numbers and conditional checks for divisibility.

---

### 2. Sum of Even Fibonacci Terms Below a Limit
**Description:**
- This function computes the sum of all even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.
- For instance, if the limit is 100, the even Fibonacci terms are 2, 8, and 34, with their sum being 44.

**Purpose:**
- Shows how to generate the Fibonacci sequence using recursion and filter results based on specific conditions (even values).

---

### 3. Sorting Elements in a List
**Description:**
- Implements a recursive function to sort the elements of a list in ascending order.
- Utilizes comparisons and recursion to repeatedly find the smallest element and build a sorted list.

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrates list manipulation, recursion, and sorting logic.

---

### 4. Binary Map Function on a List
**Description:**
- This function applies a binary function to each element of a list with a constant value. For example, given a list `[1, 2, 3]`, a constant `10`, and a binary addition function, the result would be `[11, 12, 13]`.

**Purpose:**
- Highlights how to iterate through a list and apply transformations using recursion.

---

## General Features
- **Recursive Approach:** All functions use recursion to implement the required functionality, showcasing the power of MeTTa's recursive constructs.
- **Minimalist Syntax:** The code follows a clean and simple structure to emphasize the core logic.
- **Scalability:** These exercises can be expanded or modified to solve similar problems.

## How to Use
1. Install or set up the **MeTTa** programming environment.
2. Copy and paste the function definitions into your MeTTa interpreter.
3. Execute the sample usage examples provided with each function to test their functionality.
